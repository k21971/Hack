### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Fixed save/restore crash when accessing inventory after restore
  - Object tail strings (scroll labels, etc.) weren't NUL-terminated after restore

  - Caused by security validation modifying argv[0] used for PATH resolution
  - Affected Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 but not Arch Linux due to invocation differences
